class Indicator:
    """Interface of a correlation indicator based on three semantics obtained by projecting the input vectors into a
    non-linear mapping space. The first vector (a) is mapped into its projection (x) defined as:
        x = fa * std(a), where mean(fa) = 0 and std(fa) = 1
    while the second vector (b) is mapped into its projection (y) defined as:
        y = gb * std(b), where mean(gb) = 0 and std(gb) = 1

    By definition, projections (x, y) are centered and with standard deviation equal to the original vectors (a, b),
    while we also consider their standardized versions as <fa> and <gb>, respectively. At this point, the three
    semantics simply define three correlation indicators on <x> and <y>, specifically:

        - HGR is the Hirschfield-Gebelin-Rényi indicator, namely the Non-Linear Pearson's correlation. It is computed
          as the average of the product between the standardized projections without a scaling factor, in fact:
            pearson(x, y) = cov(x, y) / std(x) / std(y) =
                          = cov(x, y) / std(a) / std(b) =
                          = cov(fa * std(a), gb * std(b)) / std(a) / std(b) =
                          = cov(fa, gb) =
                          = mean(fa * gb)

        - GeDI is the Generalized Disparate Impact, namely the ration between the covariance of the two vectors and the
          variance of the first. Eventually, it can be computed as the average of the product between the standardized
          projections (HGR) multiplied by a scaling factor std(b) / std(a), in fact:
            cov(x, y) / var(x) = cov(x, y) / var(a) =
                               = cov(x, y) / std(a) / std(a) =
                               = cov(fa * std(a), gb * std(b)) / std(a) / std(a) =
                               = cov(fa, gb) * std(b) / std(a) =
                               = mean(fa * gb) * std(b) / std(a) =
                               = HGR(a, b) * std(b) / std(a)

        - NLC is the Non-Linear Covariance, which can be eventually computed as the average of the product between the
          standardized projections (HGR) multiplied by a scaling factor std(b) * std(a), in fact:
            cov(x, y) = cov(x, y) =
                      = cov(fa * std(a), gb * std(b)) =
                      = cov(fa, gb) * std(b) * std(a) =
                      = mean(fa * gb) * std(b) * std(a) =
                      = HGR(a, b) * std(b) * std(a)
